From Kaggle [Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ghouls-goblins-and-ghosts-boo) 

## R Scripts
- `haunted.R`: Bulk of my code for testing different models and recipes
- `dataImputationPractice.R`: In-class assignment to learn and practice data imputation methods (not needed for this dataset)
- `myFunctions.R` (*Experimental*:  Because this dataset is relatively small, I wanted to automate testing different parameters for different models

## Directories
- `Data`: Training and Testing datasets for competition
- `submissions`: Stores different predictions for various model configurations
- `becker`: R scripts that fit and predict individual models on a Statistics Department server and the resulting `.Rout` files
- `images`: Any plots or images related to the project
